# CareBot

Carebot is a Facebook messenger bot that helps college students find therapists and mental health specialists under their insurance plan. Using a conversational and friendly tone, Carebot helps narrow down your search by insurance plan, distance, gender and language preferences. We built it over a weekend at a hackathon in April hosted by ProPublica, Better Doctor and Yelp.
